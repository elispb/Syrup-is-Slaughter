# Syrup is Slaughter

Another [Three Thing Game](https://threethinggame.com/post/2017-05-12-the-fizzyo-event/), another nonsense game.

This year I was joined by Joe Kent, [Enrico Gualandi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrico-gualandi-7a8827101/), and [James Horobin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-lee-horrobin-752427169/).

## The Plan
This year we forgot to keep it simple. So we opted to try and get to grips with the monogame framework and learn how to make a multiplayer networked game in under 24 hours. This was not a clever idea.

We opted for a street fighter style game where the awaked trees and their allies defended the maple syrup from hungry Canadians and lumberjacks.

We did manage to get the basics in place fairly quickly with some placeholder assets but as it turns out taking a multiplayer game and then networking it takes a little time and prehaps some practice. In the end we abandoned the online aspect and stuck with local multiplayer.

## Acknowledgements
Enrico saved us by staying all night and replacing our placeholder assets with his own work and I must say it looks a lot better without Nicolas Cage's face everywhere.
